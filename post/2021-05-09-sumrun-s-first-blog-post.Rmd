In the class SDS348, I learned how to code R and the basics of Python. Below, are some of the things I have learned from Python:

1) We can use Python as a calculator:
```{python}
5-2
7*10
3+8
```

2) We can also use built in functions to determine the minimum and maximum values (along with others) from a list of numbers:
```{python}
x = list(range(2,8,2))
len(x)
min(x)
max(x)
```

3) We can slice a range of numbers from a list to grab either the middle two letters, every - element and others:
```{python}
plist = list(range(12))
plist
# Grab the middle two letters
plist[4:6]
# Grab every fourth element
plist[::-4]
# Grab odd values from 1 - 7
plist[1:8:2]
```

4) We can perform indexing in order to determine values in a list:
```{python}
list1=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
list2=['a','b','c','e','h']
list2[1]
list2[-1]
```

Along with learning the basics of Python, I learned how R and Python can play together.
```{r}
#R Code
library(reticulate)
sumrun <- "Hello"
```
```{python}
#Python Code
sumrun = "World"
print(r.sumrun, sumrun)
```
```{r}
#R Code
cat(c(sumrun,py$sumrun))
```
